9,International Conference on Generative Programming and Component Engineering,international,229,GPCE,"SAIG,GCSE",2002,,"GPCE is a conference promoting the application and innovation of foundational techniques for supporting automatic program generation. GPCE provides a venue for researchers and practitioners interested in foundational techniques for enhancing the productivity, quality, and time-to-market in software development that stems from deploying standard componentry and automating program generation. In addition to exploring cutting-edge techniques for developing generative and component-based software, our goal is to foster further cross-fertilization between the software engineering research community and the programming languages community. GPCE arose as a joint conference, merging the prior conference on Generative and Component-Based Software Engineering (GCSE) and the Workshop on Semantics, Applications, and Implementation of Program Generation (SAIG).","MDE, Program generation, Transformation"
