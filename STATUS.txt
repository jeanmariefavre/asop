ONGOING:
  implementing getAllPerspectiveIds, getAttribute  
	  in the interface (done)
		in the specification
		  update the wiki https://sites.google.com/site/mkqphd/social-objects/specifications
			update uml (done?)
		in the the implementation
		  JsonRepository
			  the attribute json format should be reviewed to include the class fragment
          when alone but not when this is embedded in a class fragment ...
      AbstractRepository
        implement loadPerspectiveSoids (should be easy)
        decide if loadAttribute should go to IModelLoader and how to implement getAttribute
			Data

TODO:

MetaRepository:
* check the correspondance with UML documentation. ImportDeclaration target a class, not a perspective!
* ask marc the constraint over the schema


AbstractRepository:
* Is the distinction between ReadOnly and Query really usefull? It is always possible to list all the elements and filter them on value as a generic implementation. This should certainly be the default behavior. In fact, a good way to proceed is that if child class redefine the query method, they can call the method with the criterion that have not been taken into account.
* Adding the notion of Type is useful and important to deal in a convinent way with references
